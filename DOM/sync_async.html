<!--

Synchronous Programming
Tasks are executed one after another, in order.
Next task waits until the current task finishes.
Blocking in nature

Asynchronous Programming
Tasks do not wait for each other.
Next task can run even if previous task is still running.
Non-blocking in nature (useful for tasks like API calls, timers, file reading).

ðŸ§  In short:
Synchronous = line by line, waiting.
Asynchronous = no waiting, tasks can happen in background.


Synchronous:-  
Synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program.
Each instruction waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution.

Asynchronous:- 
Due to synchronous programming, sometimes imp instructions get blocked due to some previous instructions, which causes a delay in the UI.
Asynchronous code execution allows to execute next instructions immediately and doesn't block the flow.
