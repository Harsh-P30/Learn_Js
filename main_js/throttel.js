/*
âš¡ Throttle
âœ… Definition: Ensures that a function is called at most once every specified time interval, no matter how often the event happens.

ðŸ‘‰ Example: On a scroll event, you might want to update something only every 500ms, not on every tiny scroll change.

ðŸ”¨ How it works
Fires immediately or after the first event.

Ignores further events until the time window passes.
