/* 
ğŸŒŠ Debounce
âœ… Definition: Ensures that a function is called only after a certain amount of time has passed since the last event.

ğŸ‘‰ Imagine youâ€™re typing in a search box, and the app only sends the search request after you stop typing for, say, 300ms.

ğŸ”¨ How it works
Fires once after the last event.

Resets the timer each time the event happens.
