/*âœ… Spread Operator (...) in JavaScript
ðŸ”¹ What is it?
The spread operator (...) is used to expand elements of an array, object, or iterable into individual elements.

Think of it like "unpacking" values! 
ðŸ§  Why Use the Spread Operator?
To copy arrays or objects

To merge arrays or objects

To pass multiple values (e.g., into a function)

To avoid mutation of original data (immutable code)  */

// Using Spread Operator with Array
const a =[1,2,3,4,5];
const b =[1,2,3,4,5];
const copy = [...a,...b];
console.log(copy);

const text ="asdf"
const nee = [...text];
console.log(nee)

// . Spread with Objects
const user = {
    name :"harsh",
    age:"20"
}
const userData ={...user};     // we are spreading object so we have to store data into object form
console.log(userData)

//  Use Spread in Functions

function sum(a,b,c,d){
    return a+b+c+d;
}

const num =[1,2,3,4];
console.log(sum(...num));
